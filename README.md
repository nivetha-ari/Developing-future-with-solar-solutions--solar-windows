# Developing-future-with-solar-solutions--solar-windows using quantum dot

The key to a future with transparent solar windows will involve nanotechnology. The windows designed with quantum dot technology will be able to harness enough energy from the sun while still letting light through the glass window plane the quantum dots are housed in quantum dots embedded in glass windows would be able to absorb light and re- emit it us infrared light towards solar cells housed at the edges of window panels, which would be used to generate power. 

**DESIGN OF SOLAR WINDOWS:**
Silicon remains the king for solar panel efficiency,but it is not transparent. The challenge is to prevent organic light converting materials from degrading quickly during use. The strength and the weakness of these materials lie in the molecules that transfer the photogenerated electrons to the electrodes, the entrance points to the circuit that either uses or stores the solar power. These materials are known generally as “ non-fullerenceacceptors”to set them apart from the more robust but less efficient “fullerence acceptors”made of nanoscale carbon mesh. Solar cells made with non-fullerence acceptors that incorporate sulfur can achieve silicon-rivaling efficiency of 18%, but they do not last as long. 

Without protecting the sunlight-converting material, the efficiency fell to less than 40% of its initial value within 12 weeks under the equivalent of 1 sun’s illumination. “Non-fullerence acceptors cause very high efficiency, but contain weak bonds that easily dissociate under high energy photons common in sunlight,” 

**EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE:**
By studying the nature of the degradation in those unprotected solar cells, it was  recognized that  only needed shoring up in a few places. First, UV light need to be blocked out. For that a layer of zinc oxide a common sunscreen ingredient- on the sunfacing side of the glass. 
     A thinner zinc oxide layer next to the light absorbing region helps conduct the solar generated electrons to the electrode. Unfortunately, it also breaks down the fragile light absorber, so that a layer of carbon based material called IC- SAM as a buffer. 
     In addition, the electrode that draws positively-chargedholesessentially spaces vacated by electronsinto the circuit can also react with the light absorber. To protect that flank, another buffer layer is added, this one a fullerene shaped like a soccer ball. 
     By testing these new defenses under different intensities of simulated sunlight, from the typical 1 sun up to the light of 27 suns, and temperatures up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. By studying how the performance degraded under these conditions, it is extrapolated that the solar cells would still be running at 80% efficiency after 30years. 
     Also bumping up the efficiency from the 10% achieved in the reported semitransparent moduales, closer to the 15% belived to be possible at high transparency. Because the materials can be prepared as liquids, the manufacturing costs are expected to be relatively low.
